Internet is a network of computers, a web of machines connected with one another in a seemingly chaosive pattern.

But when you zoom in and get into the nitty gritty details the network is actually structured in a very interesting way. Instead of being connected directly to one another like the previous drawing suggested, they are linked together through an intermediate piece of hardware either called a routeur or a switch. If you want to draw a paralell with the old days of the telephone, you can compare the switch to the operator you would get on the phone when you would ask him to connect you with someone else.

This is the piece of the puzzle we are going to look at. The switch. How is the wiring made to connect everything together.


## Cross Bar Networks

Cross bars is the most basic way to connect 2 arrays of devices with each other so that each input has access to all the ouputs. Think of it like a road grid. You need to connect 2 towns to two other towns with highways. How would you do it ?

The previous image underlines the analogy between city connections and the cross bar network. The cities on the left are connected with highways on the left. On the right, in the electronic system, inputs and outputs are connected with wires. The part highlighted in red are the interchange on the highway analogy and switches on the electronic side.

One of the issues with that type of network topology is that building the network with all the switches and connections gets really expensive when the number inputs and outputs get really big.

This is when clos network comes to the rescue.

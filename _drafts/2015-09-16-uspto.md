I went to a conference about what to expect in the patent process.

Difference between provisional and non-provisional

Rejection of patent not the end at all

Patent right to exclude others limited term
no world wide patent

Patent have to be filed separately => idea service to do worldwide patent

Utility => works and used
Design => the way it looks no provisional

file patent to be part of the assets more leveraging power

Provisional low cost to get a priority date has to be complete cannot be modified afterwards not published
Non provisional examined

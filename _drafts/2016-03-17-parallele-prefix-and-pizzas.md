## Parallele Prefix explained with pizzas

Parallele prefix is a concept of the parallele and distributed computing world but can be seen, like most computer science concepts, as a real world process. To explain it, we are going to go through an illustrated story. 

Giovani is a rising Italian Chef, as a marketing move he decides to participate in a pizza competition. That competition is a bit special, you have to make the best pizza of them all, but you also have to make pizzas that respresent all the steps of the cooking process. In other words, for a simple Margharita that's made with dough, tomatoe and mozarella cheese, he has to make 3 pizzas:

* **Pizza 1:** Dough
* **Pizza 2:** Dough + tomatoe
* **Magharita:** Dough + tomatoe + Mozarella

And, of course, he has to do that as quick has possible.

Thinking back on the rules, Giovani realizes that nothing prevents him to get some other cook and make the pizzas in parallele. 

However, one more constraints gets added, one cook only has room for one ingredients at his table and can only mix it to one other thing during one step of the competition. Concretly that means that if a cook as Dough on his table, then in one step he make dough with on thing on it, tomatoe for example. He can't add mushrooms and tomatoe.

This restriction prevents giovani from giving each cook a sequential recipe to make each pizza, since the margharita cook can't have all the ingredients at his disposal at the same time (3 ingredients) and make the pizza.

The cooks will have to communicate and cooperate.

After thinking hard about it, he is able to come up with a plan to make all the required pizzas, in the same time it would take to make one, with a carefully thought plan.

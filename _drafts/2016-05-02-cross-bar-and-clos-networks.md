Internet is a network of computers, a web of machines connected with one another in a seemingly chaosive pattern.

But when you zoom in and get into the nitty gritty details the network is actually structured in a very interesting way. Instead of being connected directly to one another like the previous drawing suggested, they are linked together through an intermediate piece of hardware either called a routeur or a switch. If you want to draw a paralell with the old days of the telephone, you can compare the switch to the operator you would get on the phone when you would ask him to connect you with someone else.

This is the piece of the puzzle we are going to look at. The switch. How is the wiring made to connect everything together.
